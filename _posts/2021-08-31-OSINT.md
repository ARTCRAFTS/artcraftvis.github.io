### DNS

| Command-Resource | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| whois <target.com> | whois checkup |
| dig a <target> @nameserver | DNS-IP-LOOKUP |
| dig mx <target> @nameserver | MX Record Lookup |
| dig axfr <target> @nameserver (linux) | Zone-Transfer |
| nslookup -> set type=any -> ls -d blah.com | Zone-Transfer |
| https://dnsdumpster.com/ | dns recon & research, find & lookup dns records |
| https://whois.domaintools.com/ | Domain info |
   
### Finding-Subdomains
  
```
nmap --script dns-brute www.foo.com
Sublist3r #https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r / sublist3r -d yahoo.com
crt.sh #https://crt.sh/
https://github.com/OWASP/Amass #amass enum -d example.com
https://github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe
https://github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder
```
### Email
```
Employees (name, job title, phone number, manager, etc) - Linkedin,infojobs,etc.
Pictures (badge pictures, desk, computers)
https://hunter.io/ #emails
theharvester -d yahoo.com -l 500 -b google #emails
dehashed.com #email
https://www.email-format.com/ #emails, domains.
https://tools.verifyemailaddress.io/ #check if emails exist.
https://intelx.io #fun one dumps
```
Use Simply Email to enumerate all the online places (github, target site etc), it works better if you use proxies or set long throttle times so google doesn’t think you’re a robot and make you fill out a Captcha.
```
git clone https://github.com/killswitch-GUI/SimplyEmail.git
./SimplyEmail.py -all -e TARGET-DOMAIN
```
Simply Email can verify the discovered email addresss after gathering.
