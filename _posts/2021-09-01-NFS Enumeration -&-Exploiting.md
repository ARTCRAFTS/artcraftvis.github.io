## Searchsploit tricks
```
searchsploit <service version> #Example
searchsploit apache mod_ssl #Other example
searchsploit -m 7618 #Paste the exploit in current directory
searchsploit -p 7618[.c] #Show complete path
searchsploit -x 7618[.c] #Open vi to inspect the exploit
searchsploit --nmap file.xml #Search vulns inside an nmap xml result

# What is NFS?

NFS stands for "Network File System" and allows a system to share directories and files with others over a network. By using NFS, users and programs can access files on remote systems almost as if they were local files. It does this by mounting all, or a portion of a file system on a server. The portion of the file system that is mounted can be accessed by clients with whatever privileges are assigned to each file.

## How does NFS work?


We don't need to understand the technical exchange in too much detail to be able to exploit NFS effectively- however if this is something that interests you, I would recommend this resource: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/816-4882/6mb2ipq7l/index.html

First, the client will request to mount a directory from a remote host on a local directory just the same way it can mount a physical device. The mount service will then act to connect to the relevant mount daemon using RPC.

The server checks if the user has permission to mount whatever directory has been requested. It will then return a file handle which uniquely identifies each file and directory that is on the server.

If someone wants to access a file using NFS, an RPC call is placed to NFSD (the NFS daemon) on the server. This call takes parameters such as:

* The file handle
* The name of the file to be accessed
* The user's, user ID
* The user's group ID
* These are used in determining access rights to the specified file. This is what controls user permissions, I.E read and write of files.

## What runs NFS?

Using the NFS protocol, you can transfer files between computers running Windows and other non-Windows operating systems, such as Linux, MacOS or UNIX.

A computer running Windows Server can act as an NFS file server for other non-Windows client computers. Likewise, NFS allows a Windows-based computer running Windows Server to access files stored on a non-Windows NFS server.

## More Information:

Here are some resources that explain the technical implementation, and working of, NFS in more detail than I have covered here.

## What is Enumeration?

Enumeration is defined as "a process which establishes an active  
connection to the target hosts to discover potential attack vectors in  
the system, and the same can be used for further exploitation of the  
system." - Infosec Institute. It is a critical phase when considering how to enumerate and exploit a remote machine- as the information you will use to inform your attacks will come from this stage

## Requirements

In order to do more advanced enumeration of  
the NFS server, and shares- we're going to need a few tools. The first  
of which is key to interacting with any NFS share from your local  
machine- nfs-common.

## NFS-Common

It is important to  
have this package installed on any machine that uses NFS, either as  
client or  
server. It includes programs such as: lockd, statd, showmount, nfsstat,  
gssd,  
idmapd and mount.nfs. Primarily, we are concerned with "showmount" and  
"mount.nfs" as these are going to be most useful to us when it comes to  
extracting information from the NFS share. If you'd like more  
information about this package, feel free to read: [https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/nfs-common](https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/nfs-common).  
You can install nfs-common using "sudo apt install nfs-common",  
it is part of the default repositories for most Linux distributions-  
such as the Kali Remote Machine that is provided to TryHackMe  
subscribers.

## Port Scanning

Port scanning has been covered many times before, so I'll only cover the basics that you need for this room here. If you'd like to learn more about nmap in more detail please have a look at the nmap room.

The first step of enumeration is to  
conduct a port scan, to find out as much information as you can about  
the services, open ports and operating system of the target  
machine. You can go as in depth as you like on this, however I suggest  
using 
```
nmap with the -A and -p- tags.
```

## Mounting NFS shares

Your client’s system needs a directory where all the content shared by  
the host server in the export folder can be accessed. You can create  
this folder anywhere on your system. Once you've created this mount point, you can use the "mount" command to connect the NFS share to the mount point on your machine. Like so:

sudo mount -t nfs IP:share /tmp/mount/ -nolock

## Let's break this down

Tag Function  
sudo Run as root  
mount Execute the mount command  
-t nfs Type of device to mount, then specifying that it's NFS  
IP:share The IP Address of the NFS server, and the name of the share we wish to mount  
-nolock Specifies not to use NLM locking

Now we understand our tools, lets get started!

Time to mount the share to our local machine!

First, use “mkdir /tmp/mount” to create a directory on your machine to mount the share to. This is in the /tmp directory- so be aware that it will be removed on restart.

Then, use the mount command we broke down earlier to mount the NFS share to your local machine

## We're done, right?

Not quite, if you have a low privilege shell on any machine and you found that a machine has an NFS share you might be able to use that to escalate privileges, depending on how it is configured.

## What is root_squash?

By default, on NFS shares- Root Squashing is enabled, and prevents anyone connecting to the NFS share from having root access to the NFS volume. Remote root users are assigned a user “nfsnobody” when connected, which has the least local privileges. Not what we want. However, if this is turned off, it can allow the creation of SUID bit files, allowing a remote user root access to the connected system.

## SUID  
So, what are files with the SUID bit set? Essentially, this means that the file or files can be run with the permissions of the file(s) owner/group. In this case, as the super-user. We can leverage this to get a shell with these privileges!

## Method

This sounds complicated, but really- provided you're familiar with how SUID files work, it's fairly easy to understand. We're able to upload files to the NFS share, and control the permissions of these files. We can set the permissions of whatever we upload, in this case a bash shell executable. We can then log in through SSH, as we did in the previous task- and execute this executable to gain a root shell!

## The Executable

Due to compatibility reasons, we'll use a standard Ubuntu Server 18.04 bash executable, the same as the server's- as we know from our nmap scan. You can download it here.

## Mapped Out Pathway:

If this is still hard to follow, here's a step by step of the actions we're taking, and how they all tie together to allow us to gain a root shell:

```
NFS Access ->

    Gain Low Privilege Shell ->

        Upload Bash Executable to the NFS share ->

            Set SUID Permissions Through NFS Due To Misconfigured Root Squash ->

                Login through SSH ->

                    Execute SUID Bit Bash Executable ->

                        ROOT ACCESS```
```

```
nmap -p 111 --script=nfs-ls,nfs-statfs,nfs-showmount MACHINE_IP
```
