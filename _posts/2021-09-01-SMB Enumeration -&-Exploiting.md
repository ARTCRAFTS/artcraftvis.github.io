## Searchsploit tricks

```
searchsploit <service version> #Example
searchsploit apache mod_ssl #Other example
searchsploit -m 7618 #Paste the exploit in current directory
searchsploit -p 7618[.c] #Show complete path
searchsploit -x 7618[.c] #Open vi to inspect the exploit
searchsploit --nmap file.xml #Search vulns inside an nmap xml result
```
## Default Port

```
139
445
```

## What is SMB?


SMB - Server Message Block Protocol - is a client-server communication protocol used for sharing access to files, printers, serial ports and other resources on a network. [source]

Servers make file systems and other resources (printers, named pipes, APIs) available to clients on the network. Client computers may have their own hard disks, but they also want access to the shared file systems and printers on the servers.

The SMB protocol is known as a response-request protocol, meaning that it transmits multiple messages between the client and server to establish a connection. Clients connect to servers using TCP/IP (actually NetBIOS over TCP/IP as specified in RFC1001 and RFC1002), NetBEUI or IPX/SPX.

## How does SMB work?

Once they have established a connection, clients can then send commands (SMBs) to the server that allow them to access shares, open files, read and write files, and generally do all the sort of things that you want to do with a file system. However, in the case of SMB, these things are done over the network.

## What runs SMB?

Microsoft Windows operating systems since Windows 95 have included client and server SMB protocol support. Samba, an open source server that supports the SMB protocol, was released for Unix systems.


## Enumeration and & Exploiting

# Enum4Linux

Enum4linux is a tool used to enumerate SMB shares on both Windows and Linux systems. It is basically a wrapper around the tools in the Samba package and makes it easy to quickly extract information from the target pertaining to SMB. It's installed by default on Parrot and Kali, however if you need to install it, you can do so from the official

[https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/enum4linux](https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/enum4linux)

The syntax of Enum4Linux is nice and simple: "enum4linux \[options\] ip"

TAG FUNCTION

-U get userlist  
-M get machine list  
-N get namelist dump (different from -U and-M)  
-S get sharelist  
-P get password policy information  
-G get group and member list

-A all of the above (full basic enumeration)

# Types of SMB Exploit

While there are vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-7494 [https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-7494/](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-7494/) that can allow remote code execution by exploiting SMB, you're more likely to encounter a situation where the best way into a system is due to misconfigurations in the system. In this case, we're going to be exploiting anonymous SMB share access- a common misconfiguration that can allow us to gain information that will lead to a shell.

## SMBClient

Because we're trying to access an SMB share, we need a client to access resources on servers. We will be using SMBClient because it's part of the default samba suite. While it is available by default on Kali and Parrot, if you do need to install it, you can find the documentation here.

We can remotely access the SMB share using the syntax:
```

"smbclient //\[IP\]/\[SHARE\]"
```

Followed by the tags:

```
-U \[name\] : to specify the user

-p \[port\] : to specify the port
```

What would be the correct syntax to access an SMB share called "secret" as user "suit" on a machine with the IP 10.10.10.2 on the default port?

```
smbclient //10.10.10.2/secret -U suit -p 445
smbclient //$ip/profiles -U Anonymous
smbclient -L \\10.10.53.96 -I 10.10.53.96
python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/smbclient.py -no-pass slowkep@ip
python3 / usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/psexec.py 'USER:PASSWORD'@IP

```
## Visualize files

```
more "file.txt"
```

## enum4linux

```
enum4linux -M <target> #machine name
enum4linux -G <target> #For groups
nmap -p 445 --script=smb-enum-shares.nse,smb-enum-users.nse MACHINE_IP
```

## Connect-SMB

```
smbmap -H <ip> #Enumerate shares
smbclient //<ip>/share to connect
smbclient -L ip #listshares
smbclinet //ip/share -U user #si tenemos password
smbclient -N -L \\\\IP\\ #avaiable shares
smbclient -N \\\\IP\\SHARE #TO VIEW SHARE
smbclient //<IP>/SHARE
smbclient //<ip>/SHARE -u <user> -p <port>
get "filename" <output.txt>
ssh -i privatekeys.txt cactus@ip
smbget -R smb://<ip>/anonymous # download all
```
